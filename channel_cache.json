            "description": "I was a founding maintainer of Ollama, the first evangelist at Datadog, and a former organizer of DevOps Days Seattle, DevOps Days Boston, and Serverless Days Boston. In my day job, I tour the country speaking at conferences and writing about the company I work at. But I am also passionate about gadgets. Some folks don't think that word is appropriate, but it totally fits here. If you meet me in person you will see me light up when I can share with you my latest gadget, tool, or utility. And this is where I get to share that with all of you. You can find more about me at my website (http://technovangelist.com) or on Twitter (http://twitter.com/technovangelist)",
